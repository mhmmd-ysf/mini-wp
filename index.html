          Can I tell you something just between you and me?
          When I hear your voice, I know I'm finally free
          Every single word is perfect as it can be
          And I need you here with me
          When you lift me up, I know that I'll never fall
          I can speak to you by saying nothing at all
          Every single time, I find it harder to breathe
          'Cause I need you here with me
          Every day
          You're saying the words that I want you to say
          There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
          Now I know I'm falling in deep
          'Cause I need you here with me
          Every day
          You're saying the words that I want you to say
          There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
          Now I know I'm falling in deep
          'Cause I need you here with me
          I think I see your face in every place that I go
          I try to hide it, but I know that it's gonna show
          Every single night, I find it harder to sleep
          'Cause I need you here with me
          Everyday
          You're saying the words that I want you to say
          There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
          Now I know I'm falling in deep
          'Cause I need you here with me
          Every day
          You're saying the words that I want you to say
          There's a pain in my heart and it won't go away
          Now I know I'm falling in deep
